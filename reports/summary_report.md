# AgriPricePrediction Project Summary

## Introduction
This project aims to develop machine learning models to predict the prices of agri-horticultural commodities such as pulses and vegetables.

## Data Overview
The data used in this project was sourced from various datasets provided by the Ministry and other reliable sources. It includes features such as historical prices, weather conditions, and other relevant variables.

## Methodology
The project followed these steps:
1. **Data Exploration**: Initial exploration to understand the data distribution and relationships between variables.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, feature engineering, and scaling.
3. **Modeling**: Training multiple models including baseline ARIMA and RandomForest.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters for better performance.

## Results
- **Best Model**: The RandomForestRegressor with tuned hyperparameters performed the best with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of X and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of Y.
- **Baseline Model**: The ARIMA model achieved a baseline performance with an MAE of Z.

## Conclusion
The model can be used for future price predictions, which could help farmers and stakeholders make informed decisions.

## Future Work
- **Model Improvement**: Experiment with other machine learning models.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the model using a web service for real-time predictions.
